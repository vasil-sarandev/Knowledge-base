# Redis

#technology

Redis is an open-source, **in-memory data store** used as a database, cache, and message broker. It offers sub-millisecond latency, making it ideal for performance-critical use cases.

## Core Concepts

- **In-Memory**: Data is stored in RAM â†’ extremely fast reads/writes.
- **Data Structures**: Supports strings, lists, sets, hashes, sorted sets, streams, hyperloglogs, and bitmaps.
- **Persistence Options**:
	- **RDB (Redis Database Backup)** - RDB creates point-in-time snapshots of the dataset at specified intervals, offering efficient storage with minimal performance impact, making it suitable for periodic backups but with potential data loss between snapshots.
	- **AOF (Append-Only File)** - AOF logs every write operation to disk, providing higher data durability by allowing finer-grained recovery, though it can be more resource-intensive.
- **Typical use cases**:
	- **Caching** (query results, API responses, sessions)
	- **Real-time messaging** (via Pub/Sub or Streams)
	- **Rate limiting** (token bucket, sliding window)
	- **Queue systems** (using lists or streams)
	- **Leaderboard / Ranking** (with sorted sets)
	- **Distributed locks** (e.g., with Redlock algorithm)
