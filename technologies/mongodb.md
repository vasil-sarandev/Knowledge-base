## Core Concepts

- A **document** is a key-value data structure (similar to a JSON object).
- Documents are stored in **collections**, which are analogous to tables in relational databases.
- Field values can include other documents, arrays, or arrays of documents.

## Schema Design: Embedding vs Referencing

When modeling data, choose between **embedding** and **referencing** based on how your application accesses related data.

### Embedded Documents (Denormalized)

- Store related data in a single document.
- Enables fast, one-operation reads.
- Best when related data is frequently read together.
- Watch out for large document sizes and duplication across documents.
### Referenced Documents (Normalized)

- Use references (e.g., `customerId` in `orders`) to link documents across collections.
- Better when data is reused in many places and updated independently.
- Requires additional queries (or `$lookup`) to resolve references.

For most MongoDB use cases, **denormalized (embedded) models are recommended**, unless:

- Data duplication leads to frequent updates across many documents.
- Referenced data is large or shared across many entities.

## Atomicity and Transactions

While MongoDB doesn't strongly adhere to the ACID model, a write operation is [atomic](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/glossary/#std-term-atomic-operation) on the level of a single document, even if the operation modifies multiple values. When multiple update commands happen in parallel, each individual command ensures that the query condition still matches.

For

To guarantee that concurrent update commands do not conflict with each other, you can specify the expected current value of a field in the update filter.
