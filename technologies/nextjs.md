## Core Concepts

- **File-based Routing**: Create pages by adding files in the `/pages` directory.
- **Pre-rendering**: Supports Static Generation (SSG) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for better performance and SEO.
- **API Routes**: Build backend endpoints inside the same project under `/pages/api`.
- **Built-in CSS and Sass Support**: Import CSS/Sass files directly or use CSS-in-JS libraries.
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic image resizing and optimization with the `<Image>` component.
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Update static pages after build without full redeploy.
- **Fast Refresh**: Instant feedback during development with preserved component state.
- **Middleware**: Runs code before a request is completed, useful for authentication, redirects, etc.
