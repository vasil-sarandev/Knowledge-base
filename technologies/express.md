#technology

Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web framework for building APIs and web applications. It provides a thin layer of fundamental web app features without hiding Node's core HTTP modules, making it ideal for creating custom server-side logic.

## Core Concepts

- **Routing**: Map HTTP methods + URLs to handler functions.
- **Middleware**: Functions executed in the request-response cycle (logging, auth, error handling, etc.).
- **Request/Response Objects**: Built on top of Node.js’s HTTP modules, enriched with helpful methods.
- **Minimal by Design**: Does not enforce project structure or include features like ORM, authentication, or validation — BYO (bring your own) stack.
