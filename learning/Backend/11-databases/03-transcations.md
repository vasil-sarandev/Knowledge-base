### Transactions

#### Introduction

In database systems, a transaction is a series of operations that are executed as a single, atomic unit to ensure data integrity and consistency.

Transactions adhere to the ACID properties:

- Atomicity ensures all operations complete successfully or none are applied
- Consistency maintains the databaseâ€™s valid state
- Isolation prevents transactions from interfering with each other - Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent.

These properties collectively ensure that databases handle concurrent operations reliably and maintain accurate and consistent data even in the face of failures.
