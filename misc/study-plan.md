# Study Plan

## Phase 1 â€“ Deepen Core Backend Skillset (emphasis on Node & Mongo)

**Goal**: Build and deploy a full system using a JS-based stack + core DevOps tools

1. Wrap up backend software engineering [v]
2. Computer Science [v]
3. System Design [v]
4. NodeJS [v]
5. Express [v]
6. MongoDB [v]
7. Redis [WIP]
8. Docker
9. Prometheus & Grafana
10. Microservices with NodeJS
11. Message brokers


I suggest you do a URL-shortener to put into practice all your refreshed knowledge.

## Phase 2: Expand with Relational Databases (PostgreSQL)

**Goal**: Reinforce concepts, performance tradeoffs, and relational databases.

1. SQL & PostgreSQL & ORMs

Once you're ready with the cheatsheets and learning, build a TicketMaster Clone.

---
## Phase 3: Strategic Language Expansion

Goal: Broaden job eligibility for large-scale backend roles (Java, .NET)

- Java & Spring Boot  (Head-First Java, Java Docs)

Once you're ready with learning, build the TicketMaster clone again, but this time with Java and PostgreSQL.

--- 
## Phase 4: Infra/Cloud Readiness

Goal: Understand how to deploy, scale, and manage infra across environments

1. DevOps 
2. Kubernetes
3. AWS
4. Terraform

Maybe build something small when you're done with those.

---
## Phase 5: Additional languages & Technologies

Goal: further increase job eligibility for Big-Tech.

- Golang (Learning Go, Go docs)
- Graphql
- Way furher down the line: .NET

---
## Phase 6: LeetCode problems / Additional Projects

Start with the https://neetcode.io/roadmap.

Here are some other examples of projects you can do:

- https://roadmap.sh/projects/scalable-ecommerce-platform 

---

## Phase 7: Maintenance of skillset & knowledge

- Stay up to date with latest tech & frameworks. Find twitter accounts or reddit communities to be active in.
- Practice LeetCode daily.
