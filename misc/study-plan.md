# Study Plan

## Phase 1 – Deepen Core Backend Skillset (emphasis on Node & Mongo)

**Goal**: Build and deploy a full system using a JS-based stack + core DevOps tools

1. Wrap up backend software engineering [v]
2. Computer Science [v]
3. System Design [v]
4. DevOps [WIP]
5. NodeJS
6. MongoDB
7. Redis
8. Docker
9. Message brokers


I suggest you do the TicketMaster clone to put into practice all your refreshed knowledge.

Here are some other examples of what you can do:

## Phase 2: Expand with Systems-Oriented Stack (Golang & PostgreSQL)

**Goal**: Reinforce concepts, performance tradeoffs, and typed backend dev.

1. Golang
2. SQL & PostgreSQL

Build the same project(s) you did with Node&MongoDB and all the new technologies.

---
## Phase 3: Infra/Cloud Readiness

Goal: Understand how to deploy, scale, and manage infra across environments

1. Kubernetes
2. Graphql
3. AWS
4. Terraform

Maybe build something small when you're done with those.

--- 
## Phase 4 – Strategic Language Expansion

Goal: Broaden job eligibility for large-scale backend roles (Java, .NET)

- Java & Springboot 
- Way further down the line: .NET

---
## Phase 5: LeetCode problems

Start with the https://neetcode.io/roadmap.

---

## Phase 6: Maintenance of skillset & knowledge

- Stay up to date with latest tech & frameworks. Find twitter accounts or reddit communities to be active in.
- Practice LeetCode daily.
