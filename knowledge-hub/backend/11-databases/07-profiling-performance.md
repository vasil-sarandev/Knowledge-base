#### Introduction

Profiling performance involves analyzing a system or applicationâ€™s behavior to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and areas for optimization.

This process typically involves collecting detailed information about resource usage, such as CPU and memory consumption, I/O operations, and execution time of functions or methods.

Profiling tools can provide insights into how different parts of the code contribute to overall performance, highlighting slow or resource-intensive operations. By understanding these performance characteristics, developers can make targeted improvements, optimize code paths, and enhance system responsiveness and scalability. Profiling is essential for diagnosing performance issues and ensuring that applications meet desired performance standards.
