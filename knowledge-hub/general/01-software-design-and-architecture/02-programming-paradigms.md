#### Introduction

A programming paradigm is a fundamental style or approach to solving problems using a programming language. Different programming paradigms provide different ways of organizing and structuring code, and have different strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most common programming paradigms include:

- Functional programming
- Object-oriented programming
- Imperative programming
- Logic programming
- Declarative programming

#### Functional Programming

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of pure functions and immutable data. It is a way of writing computer programs that emphasizes the use of functions and mathematical concepts, such as recursion, rather than using objects and classes like in object-oriented programming.

In functional programming, functions are first-class citizens, which means they can be passed as arguments to other functions and returned as values.

Functional programming encourages immutability, which means that once a variable is assigned a value, it cannot be changed. This can simplify code, as it eliminates the need for state management and the bugs that can come with it.

#### Object Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of “objects”, which are instances of classes. OOP is a way of organizing and structuring code that is based on the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Encapsulation refers to the idea that an object’s internal state should be hidden and accessible only through its methods. This allows the object to control how its data is used and prevents external code from making invalid changes to the object’s state.

#### Structured Programming

Structured programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of structured control flow constructs, such as loops and conditional statements, to organize code into logical, easy-to-understand blocks.

It is a way of writing computer programs that emphasizes the use of procedures and functions, as well as data structures, to organize code and make it easier to understand, debug, and maintain.The main idea behind structured programming is to break down a program into smaller, manageable pieces that can be easily understood, tested, and modified.

This approach is opposed to the use of “goto” statements, which are considered to be unstructured and can lead to difficult-to-read and difficult-to-maintain code.
