Design patterns are general solutions to common problems that arise in software development. They provide a way to describe and communicate proven solutions to common design problems and they provide a common vocabulary for design. They are not specific to any particular programming language or technology, but rather describe the problem and the solution in a way that can be applied to many different contexts.

There are several different types of design patterns, including:

- Creational patterns
- Structural patterns
- Behavioral patterns
- Architectural patterns
