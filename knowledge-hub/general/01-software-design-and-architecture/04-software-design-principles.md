### Software Design and Development Principles

There are many software design principles that aim to guide the development of software in a way that makes it easy to understand, maintain, and extend. Some of the most common design principles include:

- [SOLID principles](./software-design-principles/solid.md)
- [DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)](./software-design-principles/dry.md)
- [YAGNI (You Ain’t Gonna Need It)](./software-design-principles/yagni.md)
- [KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)](./software-design-principles/kiss.md)
- [Composition over Inheritance](./software-design-principles/composition-over-inheritance.md)
- [Other Design and Development Principles](./software-design-principles/other-design-and-development-principles.md)

By following these design principles, software can be developed in a way that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend, and that is less prone to bugs.
