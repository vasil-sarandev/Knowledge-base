# Tries

Tries are a data structure that can be used to store strings. 

The idea is to store the characters of the string in a tree-like structure, where each node of the tree represents a single character and each vertex represent a single word or a prefix. We can use this structure to store strings in a way that allows us to quickly search for strings with a common prefix.

**Example** 

The next figure shows a trie with the words “tree”, “trie”, “algo”, “assoc”, “all”, and “also.”
