## Graphs

Graphs are non-linear data structures made up of a finite number of nodes or vertices and the edges that connect them. 

Graphs are used to address real-world problems in which it represents the problem area as a network like telephone networks, circuit networks, and social networks.

### Directed Graph

A directed graph is graph, i.e., a set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected together, where all the edges are directed from one vertex to another. A directed graph is sometimes called a digraph or a directed network.

### Undirected Graph

An undirected graph is graph, i.e., a set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected together, where all the edges are bidirectional. An undirected graph is sometimes called an undirected network

### Spanning Tree

A spanning tree is a subset of Graph G, which has all the vertices covered with minimum possible number of edges. Hence, a spanning tree does not have cycles and it cannot be disconnected.
