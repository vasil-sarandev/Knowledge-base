## Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of reaching a globally optimal solution. They are efficient for problems with the greedy-choice property and optimal substructure, such as scheduling, pathfinding, and resource allocation.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It is a very common algorithm used in computer science and is used in many applications such as GPS navigation, network routing, and finding the shortest path in a maze.

### Huffman Coding

Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. The idea is to assign variable-length codes to input characters, lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding characters. The most frequent character gets the smallest code and the least frequent character gets the largest code.

### Kruskal Algorithm

Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph. 

It is a minimum spanning tree algorithm that takes a graph as input and finds the subset of the edges of that graph which form a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized. 

If the graph is not connected, then it finds a minimum spanning forest (a minimum spanning tree for each connected component).

### Ford Fulkerson Algorithm

Ford Fulkerson Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that is used to find the maximum flow in a flow network. It is also known as the Edmonds-Karp Algorithm.

### Prim's Algorithm

Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. 

A minimum spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight. 

A minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph is also called a minimum weight spanning tree or minimum cost spanning tree.
