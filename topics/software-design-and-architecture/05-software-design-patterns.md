Design patterns are general solutions to common problems that arise in software development. They provide a way to describe and communicate proven solutions to common design problems and they provide a common vocabulary for design. They are not specific to any particular programming language or technology, but rather describe the problem and the solution in a way that can be applied to many different contexts.

There are several different types of design patterns, including:

- Creational patterns
- Structural patterns
- Behavioral patterns
- Architectural patterns

### POSA Patterns

[Overview of Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern-Oriented_Software_Architecture)

POSA (Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture) is a set of design patterns for developing software systems that can scale and adapt to changing requirements. These patterns were first described in the book “Patterns of Scalable, Reliable Services” by Kevin Hoffman.

POSA patterns are divided into four categories:

- Partitioning Patterns
- Placement Patterns
- Routing Patterns
- Federation Patterns
