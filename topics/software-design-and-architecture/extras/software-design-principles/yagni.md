## YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need it)

YAGNI (You Ain’t Gonna Need It) is a software development principle that suggests that developers should not add functionality to a codebase unless it is immediately necessary. The idea is to avoid creating unnecessary complexity in the codebase by only adding features that are actually needed.

The YAGNI principle is closely related to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and the Open-Closed Principle (OCP), which are part of the SOLID principles. YAGNI aims to keep the codebase as simple as possible by avoiding the creation of unnecessary abstractions and functionality.
