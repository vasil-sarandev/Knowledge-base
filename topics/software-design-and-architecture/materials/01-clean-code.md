# Clean code

## Introduction

Clean code is code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. It follows a set of principles that are designed to make the code more readable, testable, and less error-prone. Some of the key principles of clean code include:

- Clarity: The code should be easy to read and understand.
- Simplicity: The code should be as simple as possible, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
- Comments: Comments should be used sparingly and only when necessary to explain complex or non-obvious code.
- Naming: Variables, functions, and classes should have meaningful and descriptive names.
- Formatting: The code should be consistently formatted to improve readability.
- Functionality: The code should be organized into small, single-purpose functions and classes.
- Error handling: The code should handle errors in a consistent and predictable way.
- Testing: The code should be testable and have a high test coverage.
- Reusability: The code should be designed to be reusable and modular.
- Performance: The code should be designed to be efficient and performant.
