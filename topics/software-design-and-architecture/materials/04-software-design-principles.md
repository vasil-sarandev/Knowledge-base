# Software Design and Development Principles

There are many software design principles that aim to guide the development of software in a way that makes it easy to understand, maintain, and extend. Some of the most common design principles include:

- [SOLID](solid.md)
- [DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)](dry.md)
- [YAGNI (You Ain’t Gonna Need It)](yagni.md)
- [KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)](kiss.md)
- [Composition over Inheritance](composition-over-inheritance.md)
- [Other Design and Development Principles](other-design-and-development-principles.md)

By following these design principles, software can be developed in a way that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend, and that is less prone to bugs.
