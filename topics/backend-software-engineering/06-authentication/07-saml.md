#### SAML

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an XML-based framework used for single sign-on (SSO) and identity federation, enabling users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple applications or services.

It allows for the exchange of authentication and authorization data between an identity provider (IdP) and a service provider (SP). SAML assertions are XML documents that contain user identity information and attributes, and are used to convey authentication credentials and permissions.

By implementing SAML, organizations can streamline user management, enhance security through centralized authentication, and simplify the user experience by reducing the need for multiple logins across different systems.
