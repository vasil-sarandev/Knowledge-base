# # Containerization vs Virtualization

Containerization and Virtualization are both technologies for isolating and running multiple applications on shared hardware, but they differ significantly in approach and resource usage. 

Virtualization creates separate virtual machines (VMs), each with its own operating system, running on a hypervisor. This provides strong isolation but consumes more resources. 

Containerization, exemplified by Docker, uses a shared operating system kernel to create isolated environments (containers) for applications. Containers are lighter, start faster, and use fewer resources than VMs. Theyâ€™re ideal for microservices architectures and rapid deployment. 

Virtualization offers better security isolation and is suitable for running different operating systems on the same hardware. 

Containerization provides greater efficiency and scalability, especially for cloud-native applications. The choice between them depends on specific use cases, security requirements, and infrastructure needs.
