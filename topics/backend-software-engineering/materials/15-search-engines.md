# Search Engines

Search engines like Elasticsearch are specialized tools designed for fast, scalable, and flexible searching and analyzing of large volumes of data. 

Elasticsearch is an open-source, distributed search and analytics engine built on Apache Lucene, offering full-text search capabilities, real-time indexing, and advanced querying features. Key characteristics of search engines like Elasticsearch include:

1. **Full-Text Search**: Support for complex search queries, including relevance scoring and text analysis.
2. **Distributed Architecture**: Scalability through horizontal distribution across multiple nodes or servers.
3. **Real-Time Indexing**: Ability to index and search data almost instantaneously.
4. **Powerful Query DSL**: A domain-specific language for constructing and executing sophisticated queries.
5. **Analytics**: Capabilities for aggregating and analyzing data, often used for log and event data analysis.

## Elasticsearch

Elastic search at its core is a document-oriented search engine. It is a document based database that lets you INSERT, DELETE , RETRIEVE and even perform analytics on the saved records. 

But, Elastic Search is unlike any other general purpose database you have worked with, in the past. 

Itâ€™s essentially a search engine and offers an arsenal of features you can use to retrieve the data stored in it, as per your search criteria. And that too, at lightning speeds.
