# Web Servers

Web servers are software or hardware systems that handle requests from clients (usually web browsers) and serve web content, such as HTML pages, images, and other resources.

They process incoming HTTP or HTTPS requests, interact with application servers or databases if needed, and send the appropriate response back to the client. 

Popular web servers include Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, and Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). 

Web servers are essential for hosting websites and web applications, managing traffic, and ensuring reliable access to online resources by handling concurrent connections, serving static and dynamic content, and providing security features like SSL/TLS encryption.

## Nginx

Nginx is a high-performance, open-source web server and reverse proxy server known for its efficiency, scalability, and low resource consumption. 

Originally developed as a web server, Nginx is also commonly used as a load balancer, HTTP cache, and mail proxy. It excels at handling a large number of concurrent connections due to its asynchronous, event-driven architecture. 

Nginxâ€™s features include support for serving static content, handling dynamic content through proxying to application servers, and providing SSL/TLS termination. 

Its modular design allows for extensive customization and integration with various applications and services, making it a popular choice for modern web infrastructures.
