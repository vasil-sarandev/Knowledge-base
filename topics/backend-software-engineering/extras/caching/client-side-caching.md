### Introduction

Client-side caching is a technique where web browsers or applications store data locally on the user’s device to improve performance and reduce server load.
It involves saving copies of web pages, images, scripts, and other resources on the client’s system for faster access on subsequent visits.

Modern browsers implement various caching mechanisms, including HTTP caching (using headers like Cache-Control and ETag), service workers for offline functionality, and local storage APIs. Client-side caching significantly reduces network traffic and load times, enhancing user experience, especially on slower connections.

However, it requires careful management to balance improved performance with the need for up-to-date content. Developers must implement appropriate cache invalidation strategies and consider cache-busting techniques for critical updates. Effective client-side caching is crucial for creating responsive, efficient web applications while minimizing server resource usage.
